# first-npm-package
This is a practice on how to create a public npm package.

# random-str-msg

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g random-str-msg
```
## Usage
``` bash
osumep-random-str-msg
```
